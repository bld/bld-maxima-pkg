Package to use Maxima (via ASDF) as a package within Common Lisp.

Steps required:

1. Download Maxima source code

2. Follow the Lisp-only build instructions in INSTALL.lisp for the
Lisp you will use this package with.

3. Edit the paths in the "eval-when" form at the top of
maxima-pkg.lisp to point to the corresponding Maxima source files.

4. Load & use. If there's a problem with exhausted control stack
(encountered on Win32 SBCL), try to restart and load again.

The primary function of this system is SIMP, which takes a Lisp
mathematical formula, converts it to Maxima's internal Lisp form, and
simplifies it, then converts back to a Lisp code
form. Functions/macros unrecognized as math forms are left untouched.
